                  Before coming to Cal Poly, I attended Esperanza High School in
                  Anaheim, California and am a proud member of the graduating
                  class of 2022. During my high school career I was fortunate
                  enough to focus heavily on music, which was my primary
                  interest before the pandemic. During my junior year, I was
                  re-exposed to Computer Science when by chance I got placed in
                  AP Computer Science Principles. I ended up doing excellent in
                  the class and got a 5 on the AP Exam, which led me to select
                  Computer Science as my major of choice for my college
                  applications.

                    Outside of academics, I have made a number of achievements
                    that I am very proud of. First and foremost, I became an
                    Eagle Scout on June 6th, 2019 at the end of my freshmen year
                    of high school. I designed a trophy case for the Bernardo
                    Yorba Entertainment Unit, and led a team of fellow scouts
                    and adults who helped turn my design into reality. This is
                    by far the achievement that I am most proud of. It required
                    a lot of commitment, dedication and creativity from a
                    15-year old with ADHD, but with the help of my friends and
                    family I was able to prevail.

                    The other fundamental achievement of my life was being
                    elected to the position of band president my senior year of
                    high school. It was a great honor to lead my peers in one of
                    the most successful years for the band in competition and in
                    retaining membership. I was also fortunate enough to be
                    mentored in peer-leadership, organization and event planning
                    by the incoming booster president. This unique opportunity
                    gave me the chance to be a leader outside of the solos and
                    lead parts that I played in the band, and I will never
                    forget the impact that had on me.

                    I was very fortunate enough to begin my journey through
                    CompSci sometime between my eleventh and twelfth birthdays.
                    A natural curiosity along with a recommendation from my
                    father led to me diving down the rabbit hole of JavaScript
                    and later web development on Khan Academy. I would then go
                    on to learn HTML, PHP, and basic CSS through Codecadmy as my
                    interest in coding grew. My parents had helped stoke this
                    curious and questioning nature into me ever since I was
                    little by buying me art and science kits; later my father
                    would let me make mock websites and run virtual machines on
                    our family server.

                  <p class="content">
                    This trend continued until my freshmen year of high school,
                    when band and academics began to take up most of my time. As
                    I became more involved in each respectively, I started
                    programming less and less. Eventually I quit coding all
                    together, and didn't pick it up again until I had to during
                    my junior year for AP Computer Science Principles.

                    Getting placed in AP CompSci as my junior elective, which at
                    the time was my last choice elective, was singlehandedly the
                    most influential event of my young adult life. Without the
                    instructor of that class, I would have never been able to
                    fully immerse my self in programming and design once more.
                    This teacher worked really hard to not only prepare us for
                    the AP Exam, but to also nurture us as young programmers
                    through projects. Another aspect that was really influential
                    was the ability to take on more difficult aspects of a
                    project for extra credit, which is what helped keep learning
                    C++ interesting for me. At the end of that course, I
                    finished the exam an hour early and scored a 5 thanks to the
                    preparation given to me by my instructor.

                    All of this has led me to where I am now, a freshmen at Cal
                    Poly, as well as a lead developer for a team of CPP's Google
                    Student Developer Club. I am excited to continue my
                    education in Computer Science, as well as to begin my
                    foundation in Data Science over these next four years.

                  Music has always played a large role in my life. I credit my
                  older music-taste to my mother, who would always play the best
                  music from when she grew up in the car. On her side of the
                  family, there are several musicians, one of which I got to see
                  perform live when I was very little. Once again, my parents
                  nurtured my interest by taking me to concerts, buying my
                  current trumpet and by enabling me to take lessons.

                  By the time I got to high school, I was able to become an
                  above average trumpeter for my age, and this landed me solos
                  at Esperanza as well as positions in the Southern California
                  Band and Orchestra Association's Honor Jazz Band and All Star
                  Jazz Band. My senior year, I found myself playing in seven
                  different ensembles at Esperanza, as well as for an under
                  eighteen pro band at the LA Colburn Conservatory of Music.

                  The resurfacing of Computer Science led to a tough choice my
                  senior year, and I ultimately chose compSci out of a desire
                  for financial stability. I was so conflicted that at the
                  height of receiving my college application results, I
                  submitted a last minute audition to the University of North
                  Texas and was denied. That being said, I still continue to
                  make music a lifetime goal. Most recently, I played for the
                  2022 Esperanza Alumni Band. My combo also plays gigs and
                  records videos for
