                  Before coming to Cal Poly, I attended Esperanza High School in
                  Anaheim, California and am a proud member of the graduating
                  class of 2022. During my high school career I was fortunate
                  enough to focus heavily on music, which was my primary
                  interest before the pandemic. During my junior year, I was
                  re-exposed to Computer Science when by chance I got placed in
                  AP Computer Science Principles. I ended up doing excellent in
                  the class and got a 5 on the AP Exam, which led me to select
                  Computer Science as my major of choice for my college
                  applications.

                    Outside of academics, I have made a number of achievements
                    that I am very proud of. First and foremost, I became an
                    Eagle Scout on June 6th, 2019 at the end of my freshmen year
                    of high school. I designed a trophy case for the Bernardo
                    Yorba Entertainment Unit, and led a team of fellow scouts
                    and adults who helped turn my design into reality.This is by
                    far the achievement that I am most proud of. It required a
                    lot of commitment, dedication and creativity from a 15-year
                    old with ADHD, but with the help of my friends and family I
                    was able to prevail.

                    The other fundamental achievement of my life was being
                    elected to the position of band president my senior year of
                    high school. It was a great honor to lead my peers in one of
                    the most successful years for the band in competition and in
                    retaining membership. I was also fortunate enough to be
                    mentored in peer-leadership, organization and event planning
                    by the incoming booster president. This unique opportunity
                    gave me the chance to be a leader outside of the solos and
                    lead parts that I played in the band, and I will never
                    forget the impact that had on me.
